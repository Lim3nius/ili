* Test1
  Usually something what hasn't been thoroughly data store (device) on A shoulde be mounted read-write to /mnt/my-data and write
     access has to work
** Install virtual machines
   30%
   * enable SELinux with targeted policy
   * enable firewalld with default configuration
   * root pasword is set to asdf
   * two machines gamma, delta
   * commands ping gammma, ping delta
** Cluster
   30%
   * create 2-node cluester
   * Create HTTP server working as service
     * web pages containing name of node
     * HTTP accessible from host (laptop)
     * Browser should use same approach to get to web page
** Storage
   40%
   * prepare data server on node delta that server data from gamma
   * data should be encrypted
   * loopbacks as underlying data storage
   * mount data to /mnt/encrypted at node gamma
   * use FS that allows you to have more data that is capacity of physical disk
     * (ext4 fs + lvm, btrfs)
   * Prepare script that will backup these data to node delta (without unmounting)

* Test2
  Usually something 
** Install virtual machines
   30%
   * enable SELinux with targeted policy
   * enable firewalld with default configuration
   * root pasword is set to asdf
   * two machines gamma, delta
   * commands ping gammma, ping delta
** Cluster
   40%
   * create 2-node cluester
   * create NFS mount point that will fail-over to the second node if required
     * Not required to see same data so shared storage not requred at all
   * Mount this NFS (service) on the other node. These two service 
     should not run on the same machine if possible
** Storage
   30%
   * create scenario with following properties
     * when two physical disks are brokend, the filesystem on top of them is still working
     * thete is unused ...
     * use loopbacks only
     * data hsould be encrypted
         
* Test3
  Usually something 
** Install virtual machines
   30%
   * enable SELinux with targeted policy
   * enable firewalld with default configuration
   * root pasword is set to asdf
   * two machines gamma, delta
   * commands ping gammma, ping delta
** Partitioning
   * create disk dev, 200MB
   * divide into two parts and store 150MB on each
   * mount these parts at the boot time
   
** Data Storage
   40%
   * prepare a data server on node B and server data to A
   * data encrypted during network transfer
   * data store (device) on A shoulde be mounted read-write to /mnt/my-data and write
     access has to work
